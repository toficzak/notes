## fstring

Python has f-strings, or formatted string literals since 3.6.
f"Whatever {variable}"

After variable can be added "!r", which will first call repr().

## eval

Lists like [1,2,3] can be easily changed in python into objects with eval().
Eval executes code provided as string, and since arrays are just python/json representation of this structure - it works out of the box.

Although be very, very careful with other usages:

## Simple notifications

So simple, so much possibilities.

``` python3
aa="__import__('o' + 's').system('notify-send msg')"; exec(aa)
```
## Sublisting and getting last element

``` python3
>>> list = [1,2,3,4,5]
>>> list[2:3]
[3]
>>> list[2:4]
[3, 4]
>>> list[0:4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Last element?
```
>>> list[-1]
5
```
