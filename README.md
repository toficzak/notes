Cupid

- c - composable - easy to use, reuse
    - the smaller area, the less things to go bad, API has smaller degree, is easier
    - keep API - intention revealing
    - minimal dependencies
- u - unix like - robić jedną rzecz dobrze
- p - predictable - behave as expected, and should be deterministic and observable.
- i - idiomatic - Writing “code that humans can understand” means writing code for someone else
- d - Domain-based

Cohesion

How much class is focused on one goal. High cohesion is always preferred, therefore smaller classes with singular focus.

I have always created kind of a logs. They are more or less organized dump of my thoughts mixed with new knowledge.
I kept kind of journal in multiple programs, started with something called `Joplin`, then moved to many different 
note keeping machines, just to end up with Notion. It allowed me to work for some time, but as soon as I started 
to work in serious company, I naturally leaned towards... quicker way of making notes. I just kept open one 
terminal window with active vim and simple text file. I was just adding rows of plain text, describing what
I am doing, what I think about solutions, noting new things, noting solutions, domain knowledge, etc. When 
I needed to find something... well, it was one file. `grep 'whatever' file.txt`. It just works and was exactly
like I wanted - like I needed. Pretty? No. Animations? No. Many built in features? God no - I hate programs doing 
many things. Perhaps that's why I turned to Unix systems and cannot go back - simple idea of doing one thing 
perfectly is so... appealing. 

Well, I moved to this vim-oriented way of noting stuff in work, but there is other place I note a lot of things - 
while doing my personal projects, while learning at home, etc. It was easy to keep notes in work, since 
I always work from the same computer. But usually in home I learn and/or develop many cool things, which 
might help me in work. And how to keep me notes near me? Suddenly though appeared in my mind - why not github?
I have here history of my notes done out-of-the-box, it is public, therefore easily accessible.

That's long-story-short explanation of this repo. Maybe it will be forgotten in a few days. Maybe it will be 
the thing I have been looking for.
